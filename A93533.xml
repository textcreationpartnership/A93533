            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Dare be bold ſo to call and eſteem you (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſpirit you are of,) though I be but the leaſt too of that body whereof (I beleeve) you are an eye at leaſt: And (Providence having brought your Book of Redemption to my hand, and given me time and opportunity to read it over once and again, as alſo ſeriouſly to ponder the full-mouth'd Authority of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166577:3"/>Scripture, Reaſon, and the moſt godly Learned, in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of that Foundation Truth, the face whereof hath been (and ſtill is) by moſt, almoſt as much mar'd, as was the face of the Lord and Maſter of it) I ſhould be injuriouſly unthankful to God and man, if I ſhould not acknowledg you ſo to be. For the light of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is the eye; and this light, which (by reflection of the true light) hath enlightened your eye, doth from thence again reflect upon many members, to guide their feet in the way of Grace, Mercy, Truth, and Peace.</p>
            <p>About four or five years paſt I met with two or three ſmall Tracts upon the Point, as <hi>L. S. Stocks, Horn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Owen:</hi> The firſt mentioned (coming firſt to hand) undermined my Tabernacle (as it might eaſily do, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but a ſandy foundation) and blew up the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick about mine ears, ſpoiled all my goods which I had layd up for many years, and I eſcaped only with my life, wounded and naked, deſtitute of houſe or home, food, rayment, and medicine; yet withall ſhewed me, a Stone choyce and precious, wherewith I might lay a more ſure foundation for a better houſe that could not be ſhaken: yet this Stone was rough and uneven, and I knew not as yet how to ſquare and fit it to build upon, neither have <hi>I,</hi> or heard <hi>I,</hi> of any other that could, till <hi>I</hi> found out <hi>Horn,</hi> who ſquared this ſtone to my mind at that time; alſo he provided me with many materials to build upon it. Having therefore ſo good Benefactors to bear the coſt, <hi>I</hi> thanked God and them, and fell to work. But having built two or three ſtones high, their materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als failed me. Wherefore my houſe being not yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and <hi>I</hi> weary of lying by the hedges, <hi>I</hi> made uſe of ſome of the ruines of my old houſe to finiſh my new building, and ſo patched it up as <hi>I</hi> could: but entering
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166577:3"/>into it, <hi>I</hi> found it every ſhowre (like a contentious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) a continual dropping; until <hi>I</hi> met with your Model, which having throughly viewed within and without, <hi>I</hi> found every ſtone ſo cloſe compact and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as if it had been one entire Rock; wherefore I pulled down ſo much as was faulty, and built up again according to the laſt pattern. And now I thank my God through the grace given to you and me; I have an houſe wherein to ſhelter me from all winds and weathers whatſoever, and not only ſo, but which is well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all things neceſſary for my being and well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And that in ſuch abundance, that they can never fail me to eternity, unleſs I turn prodigal, which I have no more cauſe to fear, then of cutting mine own throat. I need not expound my parable, the Moral (I believe) is obvious to the meaneſt member of your Church.</p>
            <p>To relate the divers tranſactions between the Father, Son, Spirit, and my Soul, (from the 20. to the 45. year of my pilgrimage) would exceed the bounds of an Epiſtle, and the limit of many ſheets of paper. Therefore be pleaſed with this brief and general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt. From the 20. to the 39. year of mine age I lived upon the husks of the common faith of Election, (yet did not then ſo accompt it, though ſince I have found it to be no better.) In which time I was under many Eclipſes and relapſes, and once even at the gate of deſpair; In this <hi>Epilepſie,</hi> I made uſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Antidote; Whom God loveth once, he loveth to the end; The Gifts and Calling of God are without repentance, &amp;c.</hi> But this was but a paliative cure, the cauſe ſtill remaining, depending upon the common notion of Election; during this time I was counted a Puritan, (except in my relapſes wherein I was only a ſcandal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166577:4"/>to thoſe ſo called,) then I turned to the Presbyterian, after that to the Independent, thence to the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, then to the Seeker, where ſeeking for that which could not be found, I had almoſt loſt my ſelf. Then I faced the Ranter, but found him to be ſet on fire of Hell; and knowing by woful experience, that the burnt child dreads the fire, I durſt not come near. Here I was at a loſs, and at as great a ſtrait as the Lepers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Gate of <hi>Samaria.</hi> If I ſtand here I muſt periſh, If I went back to any of the former diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Famine was there, Therefore I reſolved to yeild my ſelf to the mercy of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which I did accordingly, where I continued the ſpace of two years, not without hope, nor wiihout God in the World, (though I had rejected the Scripture, and all mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation upon it,) the viſion of all being (to me) as a Book that was ſealed, which neither learned nor unlearned could open or read, yet during this time, I had hope in God, and committed my ſoul and body to my faithful Creator, who did ſpeak peace to me in this ſtrange Land: And many times would lead me by his Spirit to the Scriptures, where I ſhould yet read with as little underſtanding, as the Eunuch: At the end of this diſpenſation I was led by the Spirit once more to the Scriptures, then opened he my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and preſt me farther to ſearch and try all things, which I did accordingly; and ſo by the grace of God, I am what I am. And now, my Father, (the Chariot and Horſmen of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God) ride on becauſe of the word of truth, charge through all oppoſition, and Jeſus Chriſt who hath ſhewed you ſo great things, as the deſpiſers and wonderers of the world will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, (though it be ſo plainly declared to them,) ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166577:4"/>ſhew you yet greater things that they may marvel. I know but two or three in all theſe Weſt-parts like-minded in this point, the reſt (which are many and zealous) though they might know that the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men, and the weakneſs of God ſtronger then men, yet are ſo bewitched with tradition, that ſeeing the viſions of God will not anſwer the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own hearts, they will make the Divel a Seer, according to that of the Poet.
